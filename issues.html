<h1> Issues </h1>
<h3> Economy </h3>
<h4>Many of the arguments against the carbon tax address the negative impact it could have on American businesses. Critics argue that such a tax will put American businesses at a disadvantage against foreign companies in China that have greater ability to pollute. However, one of the major benefits of the carbon tax as opposed to regulation or a cap-and-trade system is that the carbon tax provides revenue to the government that can be reinvested into the economy.
<br>
<ul>
  <li>$19.8 billion a year goes towards renewable energy subsidies and research every year</li>
  <li>$20 tax on carbon emissions would lead to a 15 cent increase in gas prices, and over the course of 10 years reduce emissions by 8% and raise $1.2 trillion in tax revenue
</li>
  <li>Using just 15% of the tax revenues from a $15-per-ton tax could mitigate the impact of the increase in gas prices on low-income households
</li>
</ul>
Not only would the government have the resources to invest in American jobs and businesses, but also the government could reduce the costly administrative fees of enforcing regulations. Without complex regulations, markets would become more competitive, allowing smaller businesses a chance at success. The carbon tax provides market-based incentives that a host of economists agree are substantially more effective in provoking a response than the current system of bureaucratic regulation.</h4>
