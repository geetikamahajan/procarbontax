		<h1> WHO ARE WE? </h1> 
		<h4>
	We are four high schoolers lobbying for environmental impact by introducing the carbon tax. <br> <br>
The recent influx of oil into the world market has brought many great oil producing nation's economies to their knees and promises to do so too many more. The Russian, Venezuelan, and Nigerian economies have already been damaged and the United States is well on its way down the same road. Although low gas prices may seem like a great thing to us, it has weakened many companies and promises the same to the 8 major oil producing states (Check the CHK stock over the last year). <br> <br>
<h2>There is a way to save our economy and fight the reliance we currently have on foreign energy. The carbon tax would... </h2>
-Incentivize consumers to use less petroleum-based products (42% of all U.S. carbon emissions are from petroleum products.) <br>
-Reduce deficit <br>
-Create revenue to possibly subsidize environmental programs or issue rebates <br> <br>
With these changes we can support American industry and economy while making the world a safer place for our children. The time for change is now and it all starts with one person. </h3> <h2>No more setbacks, support the carbon tax! </h2>
