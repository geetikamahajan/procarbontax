<h1> Issues </h1>
<h3> <u>Economy</u> </h3>
<h4>Many of the arguments against the carbon tax address the negative impact it could have on American businesses. Critics argue that such a tax will put American businesses at a disadvantage against foreign companies in China that have greater ability to pollute. However, one of the major benefits of the carbon tax as opposed to regulation or a cap-and-trade system is that the carbon tax provides revenue to the government that can be reinvested into the economy.
<br>
<ul>
  <li>$19.8 billion a year goes towards renewable energy subsidies and research every year</li>
  <li>$20 tax on carbon emissions would lead to a 15 cent increase in gas prices, and over the course of 10 years reduce emissions by 8% and raise $1.2 trillion in tax revenue
</li>
  <li>Using just 15% of the tax revenues from a $15-per-ton tax could mitigate the impact of the increase in gas prices on low-income households
</li>
</ul>
Not only would the government have the resources to invest in American jobs and businesses, but also the government could reduce the costly administrative fees of enforcing regulations. Without complex regulations, markets would become more competitive, allowing smaller businesses a chance at success. The carbon tax provides market-based incentives that a host of economists agree are substantially more effective in provoking a response than the current system of bureaucratic regulation.</h4>

<h3> <u>Environment</u> </h3>
<h4>Greenhouse gases trap heat within the atmosphere. In the past, the Earth self-regulated the absorption and emission of these gases. However, since the Industrial Revolution, humans have begun emitting greenhouse gases at a greater rate than ever before. The result was an increase in greenhouse gases that has caused a rise in global temperatures. Carbon dioxide makes up an astounding 80.9% of the greenhouse gases emitted through human activities, and should be the target of efforts to combat global warming.
<br>
<ul>
  <li>Carbon dioxide is 80.9% of greenhouse gas emissions caused by humans
</li>
  <li>Carbon dioxide levels were at 270 parts per million (ppm) before the Industrial Revolution, 313 ppm in 1960, and 400 ppm in the present
</li>
  <li>Carbon dioxide emissions have increased 90% since 1970
</li>
</ul>
A carbon tax is important for the environment because it inherently deters the proliferation of carbon emissions and pushes for the the development of a reliable, renewable energy. Right now, there hasn't been any business-oriented incentive for corporations to look into completely switching to a renewable source of energy. There is too much of a financial burden for modern day corporations to shift to a renewable energy source, but if the renewable option is presented as the better option financially, the switch will become more viable.</h4>
<h3> <u>Global Partnerships</u> </h3>
<h4>In late 2015 the US gov’t took part in the historic climate change Paris Conference. The conclusion of the conference was that all the countries in the conference made a promise that they would cut down on emissions by a certain deadline. The US, however, cannot reach said cut off point due to recent Supreme Court verdicts. On the other hand, experts predict that the Carbon Tax if implemented will help the US meet the goal and keep up international reputation. A fix like this would not only help the entire country, but the world as well because many countries use lack of action in the United States as their excuse for not cutting down on emissions. With the Carbon Tax the United States could once again be the international symbol of progress and hope.
<h3> <u>Energy Security</u> </h3>
<h4>Currently the United States only produces 60% of the oil it consumes per year creating a heavy dependence on the global oil market on the nation’s part. Due to this, the prices gas and oil for the everyday consumer is directly related to the supply and demand of the global market. Although this may sound natural, it has put many US companies and states in a situation where they have to compete against foreign nations who have little regulation or limitation placed on them making it very hard to compete. Hence these US companies and states economies can and have changed on the whim of foreign rulers, some of said companies experienced losses as large as 70% and were forced to make huge lay offs. This, however, is not even the first time such events have occurred, for example, the world energy crisis of the early 70s saw a similar trend of events and cause near irreparable damage to the economy. The only way for this cycle and hostage situation to be broken is for the US economy to organically move on from the unstable and unsustainable oil market to one of renewable energy. Such a change is possible through the market driven incentives and organic over time change brought on by a Carbon Tax.
