<h1> Issues </h1>
<h3> <u>Economy</u> </h3>
<h4>Many of the arguments against the carbon tax address the negative impact it could have on American businesses. Critics argue that such a tax will put American businesses at a disadvantage against foreign companies in China that have greater ability to pollute. However, one of the major benefits of the carbon tax as opposed to regulation or a cap-and-trade system is that the carbon tax provides revenue to the government that can be reinvested into the economy.
<br>
<ul>
  <li>$19.8 billion a year goes towards renewable energy subsidies and research every year</li>
  <li>$20 tax on carbon emissions would lead to a 15 cent increase in gas prices, and over the course of 10 years reduce emissions by 8% and raise $1.2 trillion in tax revenue
</li>
  <li>Using just 15% of the tax revenues from a $15-per-ton tax could mitigate the impact of the increase in gas prices on low-income households
</li>
</ul>
Not only would the government have the resources to invest in American jobs and businesses, but also the government could reduce the costly administrative fees of enforcing regulations. Without complex regulations, markets would become more competitive, allowing smaller businesses a chance at success. The carbon tax provides market-based incentives that a host of economists agree are substantially more effective in provoking a response than the current system of bureaucratic regulation.</h4>

<h3> <u>Environment</u> </h3>
<h4>Greenhouse gases trap heat within the atmosphere. In the past, the Earth self-regulated the absorption and emission of these gases. However, since the Industrial Revolution, humans have begun emitting greenhouse gases at a greater rate than ever before. The result was an increase in greenhouse gases that has caused a rise in global temperatures. Carbon dioxide makes up an astounding 80.9% of the greenhouse gases emitted through human activities, and should be the target of efforts to combat global warming.
<br>
<ul>
  <li>Carbon dioxide is 80.9% of greenhouse gas emissions caused by humans
</li>
  <li>Carbon dioxide levels were at 270 parts per million (ppm) before the Industrial Revolution, 313 ppm in 1960, and 400 ppm in the present
</li>
  <li>Carbon dioxide emissions have increased 90% since 1970
</li>
</ul>
A carbon tax is important for the environment because it inherently deters the proliferation of carbon emissions and pushes for the the development of a reliable, renewable energy. Right now, there hasn't been any business-oriented incentive for corporations to look into completely switching to a renewable source of energy. There is too much of a financial burden for modern day corporations to shift to a renewable energy source, but if the renewable option is presented as the better option financially, the switch will become more viable.</h4>
